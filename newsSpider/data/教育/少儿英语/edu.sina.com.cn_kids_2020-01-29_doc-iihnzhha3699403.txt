BBC随身英语: Slow walking and ageing 走路慢老得快

　　科学家们一直在寻找能让人们延长寿命，获得健康幸福生活的方法。本期 “随身英语” 围绕最新的一项研究展开讨论——这项研究称，人们在40多岁时走路的速度是他们的大脑和身体衰老程度的标志。走路速度较慢的人是不是应该加快步伐呢？　　　　Getting old might not be something that’s yet . But is inevitably going  one day, so it’s something I’m sure we’d all like control. It would be great to have a long, healthy and happy life, and that’s why scientists are constantly seeking out evidence that will show us what we need to do to achieve .　　We all know that regular exercise is good for us. In recent years we’ve been told to aim to walk 10,000 steps a day to remain healthy, although other advice to do three  10-minute walks a day is thought to be even more . But the latest piece of research might put if you’re someone who walks at a. That’s because, according to scientists, the speed at which people walk in their 40s is a sign of how much their, as well as their bodies, are ageing.　　The BBC’s Philippa Roxby writes that tests on 1,000 people from New Zealand born in the 1970s found that  tended to show signs of "". Their , teeth and  were in  than those who walked faster. And , the study found not only did slower walkers' bodies age more quickly, their faces looked older and they had smaller brains. Professor Terrie E Moffitt, lead author of the study, told the BBC: "[it] found that a slow walk is a problem sign decades before old age."　　This might be seen as for people with a slower  who might feel it’s time to  and get fitter. But it might be too late; researchers writing in JAMA Network Open say they were able to predict the walking speed of 45-year-olds using the results of intelligence, language and motor skills tests from when they were aged three. They also suggest that even in early life, there are signs showing which people will go on to have a healthier life.　　So, what’s the point of knowing that a slower walking pace might mean a smaller brain? Well, researchers say measuring walking speed at a younger age, and understanding what this might mean, could be a way of testing to slow human ageing. This might help us  while we’re still young and healthy.
