Mature student Kevin Helton said that "the interviewer asked, 'you used to be in the Army, how many people have you killed?'”　　But as Alison Green points out, while a candidate might feel  of an interviewer, they are able to question why they’re being asked something, and while the interviewer might be making, the candidate can also make their own judgement and decide if this is really the  they want to make!　　　　vacancy 职位空缺　　interview 面试　　prove yourself 证明自己的实力　　perspective（思考问题的）角度　　hire 雇佣　　organisation 组织，团体　　candidate 候选人，应试者　　screening 筛选　　applicant 申请人　　interviewer 面试官　　training 培训　　figure out 想出　　casual 不在意的，漫不经心的　　rapport 融洽，和谐的关系　　clicked with 一拍即合的，与……产生共鸣的　　skills and abilities 技能与能力　　inexperienced 缺乏经验的　　inappropriate 不适合的，不恰当的　　job seeker 应聘者　　at the mercy 听命于……，任凭……摆布　　judgement 判断，评判　　career move 职业发展　　　　 　　1.
