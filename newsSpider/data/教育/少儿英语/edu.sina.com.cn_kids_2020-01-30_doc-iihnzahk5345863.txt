BBC随身英语：悲伤还是快乐 你喜欢哪种音乐？

　　一项新研究表明，悲伤的音乐现在越来越受人们的欢迎。为什么人们选择听悲伤的音乐？在听这类音乐时，人们的大脑和身体中在发生着什么变化？本期 “随身英语” 围绕这项研究，浅谈为什么悲伤的音乐能让我们中的一些人感到快乐。　　　　What would life be like without music? Songs and tunes fill our lives, affecting our , bringing back  and sometimes making us dance. There is a song for everyone and for every occasion, but it seems that it’s sad music that us most.　　Sad music certainly does its job in making us , emotional, and causing us to  – it’s something we might listen to after a break-up, for example. And a recent study has shown why some people are  on sad music. Professor David Huron from Ohio State University conducted the research and looked at the difference between people who love to listen to sad music and those who can’t stand it.　　He told the BBC radio programme The Why Factor that it comes down to a natural  called . He says: “as you might have guessed from the name, it's associated with ‘lactation’ from breast-feeding. When people cry, they also release prolactin. And, there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this  effect.” It seems that people who like sad music are maybe getting too much prolactin, or more than is normal, and when they hear sad,  music, it gives them a good feeling. But if prolactin isn’t released, or there isn’t enough of it, some people find that sad sounds don’t help to .　　Previous research by Durham University has also suggested that listening to sad music can  pain and sadness; but it can also provide  and even . A high number of people they surveyed were cheered up by listening to supposedly sad songs. Though the feeling may not be exactly the same as happiness, it may be the ability to cope with the sadness that gives the feeling of comfort.　　So, reacting to sad music on the radio may have nothing to do with the sound of a string quartet or a singer who’s got , but rather a natural chemical reaction taking place in our bodies. Maybe that explanation is  if you're wondering why you’ve be listening to Adele on repeat!　　　　emotion 情绪　　memory 记忆　　move 打动，感动　　depressed 消沉的，抑郁的　　sob 抽泣　　hooked 入迷的，上瘾的　　hormone 荷尔蒙　　prolactin 催乳素　　comforting 令人安慰的　　downbeat 低调的，悲观的　　cheer sb. up 使……高兴起来，使……振作　　trigger 引起，引发（坏事）　　comfort 安慰，慰籍　　enjoyment 愉悦感　　melancholic 忧郁的　　the blues 忧伤，悲哀　　music to your ears 好消息　　　　 　　1.
